# Task Manager Application

A simple **Task Manager** web application built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Thymeleaf**, and **MySQL**.  
It allows users to create, view, update, filter, sort, and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed ("Done") and once completed, cannot be reverted to pending.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks with title, description, due date, priority, and username.
- View all tasks in a table with all details.
- Mark tasks as **Done** (completed) â€” completed tasks cannot be marked pending again.
- Filter tasks by completion status (Completed / Pending).
- Sort tasks by due date.
- Filter tasks by username.
- Delete tasks.
- Responsive UI with dynamic updates using AJAX (no page reload on add, update, delete).
- RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for API.
